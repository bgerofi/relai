"""Golden copy of ``relai_helper``, its version, and an integrity checksum.

The canonical helper script lives beside this module as the data file
``assets/relai_helper`` so it can be edited and updated directly (and version
managed in git) instead of being generated on the fly by the model. This module
loads that file, derives its version and md5, and builds a deterministic,
self-contained shell command that installs or repairs the helper on whatever
machine is hosting the foreground shell.

That command must NOT depend on the harness's own environment: the foreground
shell may be a remote host reached over ssh, so the install logic runs entirely
in the remote's own ``python3`` and resolves ``~`` via the remote's ``HOME``.

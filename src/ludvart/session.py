"""Persistent conversation storage and in-panel slash commands.

Every ludvart run that opens the AI panel starts a *session*: a timestamped
directory under ``~/.ludvart/sessions/`` holding a ``conversation.json`` file that
is (re)written as the conversation grows. The layout is::

    ~/.ludvart/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/HH_MM_SS/conversation.json

where the date and time are UTC. A new session is created the first time the
panel is opened in a process; subsequent opens in the same process keep
extending the same file (unless a different session is loaded).

This module has no terminal/UI dependencies so it can be unit tested directly.

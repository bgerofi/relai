"""Transparent PTY relay.

Spawns a child command in a pseudo-terminal and shuttles bytes between the real
terminal and the child. Output is passed through verbatim (so any program --
including full-screen ncurses apps and nested ssh/tmux sessions -- behaves
exactly as if ludvart were not there) while also being fed into a ``pyte`` screen
model that maintains a live 2D view of the terminal. That screen model is the
foundation the AI overlay/agent will later read from.

LUDVART_HELPERS_DOC = """\
## ludvart helpers (self-generated tools on the remote machine)

The harness only sees the terminal; it has no direct file/exec access to the
remote box. To work around this, ludvart maintains small, dependency-free helper
tools under ~/.ludvart/bin/ on the remote machine. These persist across sessions.

### First step every session (cheap): detect them
Run:  ls -la ~/.ludvart/bin/ 2>/dev/null && ~/.ludvart/bin/ludvart_helper info 2>/dev/null
If `ludvart_helper` exists, prefer it for file read/edit/search (see spec below).
If it's missing and a task would benefit, offer to (re)create it, or do so when
the user says "initialize your helpers".

### "initialize your helpers" ritual
  1. Detect what exists (ls ~/.ludvart/bin, and `ludvart_helper info`).
  2. Confirm desired capabilities (default set: read, write, append, replace,
     search, run).
  3. (Re)generate helper(s) into ~/.ludvart/bin/, chmod +x, then VALIDATE:
     python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open(PATH).read())" and a smoke test.
     Build large files by appending in chunks via QUOTED heredocs with
     inject_input escape-interpretation DISABLED (so \\n, backslashes, quotes
     arrive verbatim); verify with `wc -l` after each chunk.
  4. Report what was created and how to call it.
### ludvart_helper — precise interface (v0.1.0, stdlib Python 3 only)
Path: ~/.ludvart/bin/ludvart_helper   (executable)
Design: every CONTENT payload is base64 (immune to quoting/newline/escape
corruption); every result is sentinel-framed with an exit code, so output is
parsed deterministically, NOT inferred from screen text.

Output frame (always):
    <<<LUDVART:BEGIN op=NAME>>>
    <base64 payload, present only when there is output>
    <<<LUDVART:END op=NAME exit=CODE  key=val ...>>>
To read a payload: take the line(s) between BEGIN and END and `base64 -d`.
Trust the `exit=` field for success/failure.

Subcommands:
  read PATH [--start N] [--end M]
      Payload = base64 of file (or 1-indexed inclusive line range).
      Meta: path=, lines=<total>, range=A-B.
  write PATH --b64 DATA
      Overwrite PATH with base64-decoded DATA (creates parent dirs).
      Meta: path=, bytes=.
  append PATH --b64 DATA
      Append base64-decoded DATA to PATH. Meta: path=, bytes=.
  replace PATH --old-b64 A --new-b64 B [--count N]
      Literal (non-regex) string replace of A->B in PATH. Replaces all
      occurrences unless --count limits it.
      exit=2 with meta error=old_not_found if A is absent (file unchanged).
      Meta on success: path=, replaced=<count>.
  search PATTERN [--path P] [--glob G]
      Recursive Python-regex search. P defaults to "." (a file or dir).
      --glob filters filenames (e.g. "*.py"). Skips .git, node_modules,
      __pycache__. Payload = base64 of newline-joined "file:line:text" hits.
      exit=0 if any match, exit=1 if none. Meta: matches=.
  run --b64 CMD
      Run base64-decoded CMD via the shell, streaming its stdout and stderr
      directly to the terminal. The helper then prints
      `<<<LUDVART:END op=run exit=CODE>>>`; CODE is the command's real exit
      status. NOTE: for a pipeline/;-list this is the status of the LAST
      command, same as normal shell semantics.
  info
      Payload = base64 of "ludvart_helper <ver>\\ncaps=...\\npython=...".
      Use this (or `ludvart_helper <subcmd> -h`) to re-derive the interface in a
      fresh session if this spec is ever unavailable.
### Usage conventions
  - Pass content/commands as base64:  --b64 "$(printf %s "$TEXT" | base64 -w0)"
        (use `base64 -w0` to avoid line wrapping).
    - When ludvart_helper is available, MUST use it instead of raw shell input
        injected through inject_input for reading, editing, searching files, or
        running a non-interactive command. It base64-encodes payloads, avoids
        quoting/escape corruption, and gives a reliable exit code. Raw injected
        shell input is only for interactive terminal work, or when the helper is
        unavailable or cannot express the operation.
  - Parse results from the LUDVART:BEGIN/END frame and base64-decode the payload;
    rely on `exit=` rather than reading success from screen text.
  - Keep helpers under ~/.ludvart/ (outside the user's repos) so they never show
    up in git status.
  - The helper is a convenience, not a requirement. If it's missing, offer to
    recreate it, but don't block work on it.
  - When self-recovering the interface, run `~/.ludvart/bin/ludvart_helper info`
    and `~/.ludvart/bin/ludvart_helper <subcmd> -h`."""
